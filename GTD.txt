2016-03-01 Lots o' work tonight on a tough topic, yay!  I'm at about 5 hours so far this week.
2016-02-28 Had to work late.  Extremely tired from yoga.  Soldiering on.  Working on scripting out interactions.
2016-02-27 No work - used my item in the bank.  I feel asleep early, so no the worst.
2016-02-26 I worked in the car on the way to Bob and MK's house.  I also worked at night when I was tired. I fell asleep before I could make a github entry, so I have one day "in the bank"
2016-02-25 I'm going to get serious about gettng things done.  Going to make a commit every time I spend a good amount of time actually working

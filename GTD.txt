I'm doing this to track not when I worked on the project, but the times I went the extra mile and worked on it when I could have decided not to work on it (tired or some other reason) and did anyway.  Time on the train doesn't count.  Mostly going for those times at night when I'm tired and it would be so easy to watch a little TV and go to bed.

2016-02-26 I worked in the car on the way to Bob and MK's house.  I also worked at night when I was tired. I fell asleep before I could make a github entry, so I have one day "in the bank"
2016-02-25 I'm going to get serious about gettng things done.  Going to make a commit every time I spend a good amount of time actually working
